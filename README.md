--Our website will display data on the number of flights handled by specific airports. This will be done with different sized circles (with different colors, to indicate size) at the location of each airport. 

--Additionally, we will also have a map showing the percentage of flights that were late at each airport (again using different sized circles and colors). 

--For each of our maps, the user can click on the bubble of an airport and get some more detailed bar graphs. The heat maps will be animated with the circles changing size as time goes on (on a monthly basis)
