Our website will display data on the number of flights handled by specific airports. This will be done with different sized circles at the location of each airport. Additionally, we will also have a map showing the percentage of flights that were late at each airport (again using different sized circles). One can then click on the bubble of an airport and get some more detailed bar graphs.
